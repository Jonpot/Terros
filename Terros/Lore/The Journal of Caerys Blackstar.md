# Journal Pages of [[Caerys Blackstar]]
  

## January 29th, 284 NE

Rightly did the sailors speak of the wealth and civility of these lands. Just yesterday I passed through the city of [[Athina]] on the banks of [[the Locke River]]. In conversation with a merchant from the Capital passing through the city I discovered that it had been founded only twenty years earlier. It was nothing but a small fishing town occupied by the passing legions. They constructed a small fortress which had developed with rapid speed into the beautiful city which now stands before me. The streets laid with fine stone, the aqueduct running water from the mountains, the chiseled statues of the Saints of the Valley, the high-rising amphitheatre, all wrought with exquisite craftsmanship, speak to the expansion of the civil society in these lands. I cannot help but stand in awe at the accomplishments of this Emperor Maximilian for I have seen their majesty with my own eyes.

I must confess however that I feel an overpowering sense of dread as my journey stretches around [[the Myr Mountains]]. I have been in [[the Empire]] of [[Netheril]] more than a month, but these conquered lands still retain the flavor of [[the Centerlands]]. Not for over a thousand years has a [[Blackstar]] set foot in the West, yet I soon I will arrive in the city that rose to replace [[Westgard]] seeking the help of a foreign ruler who owes me no respect. I suspect I my despair also arose by the grim nature of my business and the determination of my resolve. Should my fears manifest then I believe it will be to the ruin of all civilized lands. 

Far north I ventured into lands which have no name. The Sharans spoke of the lands simply as [[Aer-Valock]] or ‘Frozen Waste’. But what insights I have taken from the place far exceed any which can be found in the dusty halls of the Tower of the Rose or the Imperial College. 

The scholar [[Veryn]] spoke true, a wise man did indeed live in a great fortress at the center of a frigid lake. Having arrived on his doorstep he greeted me and bid me inside 

His fortress was ancient; though he would not say by what peoples it was erected. A great many tomes he had accumulated, and he soon impressed me with his wisdom on all things. His retreat into these wastes had not dulled his mind nor his senses; he spoke with a great acumen on the politics of the day and of the future of the Realm. With a heavy heart I soon broached my business and by the shadow that came over his face I knew that Veryn spoke right that this man long had thought of my troubles.

He too had sought answers regarding the fate of [[Telam|the Master Maker]] and [[The Order of the Magi]]. He conveyed to me that for many years he concentrated his sorcery across the Seas of the West, but to no avail. A shadow lay over that place which by no power could he abate. 

For a long time we conversed about the First Mage and the rise of the Kingdom of the Dawn, and what the words spoken by [[Cassia]] would mean for the Realm. He confided in me that a great tragedy was approaching, and that the Realm must be strong to survive, thus confirming my suspicions. Late into the night we speculated on the nature of what was coming, but could reach no definite conclusions. He confirmed my calculations that this was the Fifteenth Age of the World and we were almost seven thousand years in the Age of Reason. This does indeed accord with the speech of the Sorcerer-Lords of Tel Dorac when they proclaimed that the Ages of the World grew shorter, and that time was shrinking thin. 

A plan though we soon reached. I would head into the West and beg an audience with the [[Emperor Maximilian]]. Should we win him to our cause we would assemble a great fleet of ships and sail into the Western Sea in search of the Isle of [[Caeta]] and the fate of the Order of Magi.

The vigor, sagacity, and prudence of the great Flame of the West did not fall below my expectations. Not only did he hear my requests, but he soon adopted me into his full faith and counsel and named me Imperial Adjunct. To me he pledged that the Empire which “stretched north to the Great [[Rockdale]], south to [[Norechium]] and [[the Sea of Scales]], and East into[[ the Ironwoods]] would now turn its gaze West in search of the truth of the Ages of Man”. In my company many schemes we soon hatched both for the improvement and health of his Realm and for the people of [[Terros]]. But the time had come to set our ultimate designs in motion and begin our journey west.

  

## October 4th, 287 NE

Today is the day that my long held desires are realizing themselves. I set sail commanding a fleet of twenty ships of the Imperial Legion across [[the Ceon Sea]] to find this Isle of Caeta. 

Upon my sailing this I know, that only five of the [[The Order of the Magi|Magi]] made it on a boat to [[Caeta]]: [[Cassia]], who had become their leader; [[Ezrien]], who had by this time returned from the Elven lands into alliance with his old friends; [[Lana]], whose ship and protection they would be sailing west under; [[Miran]], the lord of the Sands; and lastly the Keeper [[Aneius]], whose motivations I have had the hardest time unearthing. I know that [[Aneius]] was entrusted with the sword [[Corvus]], and it is said by some ancient historians that he travelled to the other side of [[the Black Gate]] into the Halls of the Dead, but this I find hard to believe. It was said by [[Diosophenes]] that no man can exit the Halls of the Dead, not even him. And it was by [[the Book of the Dead]] composed by [[Aneius]] that Diosophenes composed his teachings, making him I believe the definitive source on the supposed travelling of [[Aneius]]. 

I know that three at least have returned, or at least their blades have. It appears that [[Aneius]], [[Miran]], and [[Ezrien]] all made their way back to [[Terros]]. With [[Cassia]] I cannot confirm her passing back to [[Terros]], but her blade did at least, being carried by a wise sage into [[the Pale]]. Their high priests there still pass devotion to a Saint which they know not is [[Cassia]]. 

By the chronicaller [[Marcellus]] I know that [[Ezrien]] lived in the Ironwoods until his death, his tomb lost to [[the Kaltir Hills]] sometime in the third millennia. Though why he returned I know not. 

[[Miran]], I know from the Southlanders, moved into the [[Tesarin Valley]] and lead the desert tribes for many years before disappearing from the historical record. Once again his motivations remain mysterious to me.

[[Aneius]], recorded by the Illyrian historian [[Verenus]], arrived back in Terros sometime in the fourth millennia. He claims that he arrived in a city called [[Tela Aera]] on the Southern Coast and acquired a fleet of ships, then sailed across the channel into [[Alos]], never to be seen again. They spoke of him in a terrible fury, that he spoke to no one of his businesses and made with great haste out of these lands. 

Perhaps when I find the island my questions will be answered, but for now all that is within my power is to wait for the winds to catch our sails and to head out onto the open sea. The whole fate of the  world appears to lie before me, ready to be uncovered. I hope for all our sakes it is not so terrible.
