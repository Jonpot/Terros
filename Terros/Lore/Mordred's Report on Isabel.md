# Subject: [[Isabel]] de Roya

**Completed**: Mental and Physical Report (Page 1), Information Report (Pages 1 and 2, also copied into the Index of Reports on the Netherese Empire)
**Incomplete**: Difficulties encountered in memory extraction, elaborated in Appendix A
**Recommendation**: Releasement (See Appendix B) or use in testing on Project 9
**Biographic Details**: Born on the 5th of the 11th Month in the Year 887. Calendar Conversion Unknown. Age 26. She was born in [[Netheril|the Imperial City]] to the family De Roya of the 7th Rank. She spent most of childhood in the city of [[Caldaria]] with brief stays in imperial outposts in the Hinterlands (Reference unknown). Beginning age 12 she was educated at the Academy for Young Officers before moving to the Imperial University Officer School age 15, where based on performance she was inducted into the Imperial Court.

She took part in her first campaign in 904, joining the army of the Imperial Second Velen against [[The Holy League]] (Reference unknown). After two years she had been promoted to the rank of Captain and took part in the conquest of the Holy City of Centas in 906. She fled the city three months later after rebellion by the natives resulted in the massacre of most of the troops stationed. Memory indicates she escaped by hiding in the cart of a deaf merchant leaving the city. 

She took part in the pacification of the rebellion. Her memory indicates the city was destroyed (note: memory analysis was hindered by extremity of emotions; details were unable to be extracted). For services rendered she was granted her request to join the expeditionary force, leaving Terros in 908, age 21.

After reaching Base 17 she took the troops under her command and crossed illegally to Delos in order to seek out and destroy [[Snowpoint Base]] and slay the one she believed to be [[Casia|the Goddess of Delos]]. She believed this would further her journey to assume the Imperial Throne. She was captured at the [[Lake Etria]] five weeks ago.

**Physical Report**:
She is five feet and seven inches tall with dark brown hair and brown eyes.
Her agility and reflexes are superior, with an extremely fast reaction time. Intense training regime since childhood has resulted in great cardiovascular strength and high endurance.
Note: she suffered serious injury on the left foot, primarily at the ankle. The wound never fully healed and has resulted in periodic pain inflammation and reduced dexterity on that side.

**Mental Report**:
Her mental faculties are above average but not extraordinary. She is capable of reasoning quickly under pressure, with an exceptional visual imagination and geographic memory, although her sense of her own abilities is inflated.

For her personality she is both extremely drive and possessed of a high degree of stamina. She is very sociable and grows irritated when she is subject to periods of solitude (note: subject appears unaware of this fact). She is both proud and possessed of a strong sense of honor and justice, although has difficulty controlling her anger and is often impulsive. She has suffered from a sense of inferiority since childhood. She doesn’t believe others sufficiently respect her abilities.

She derives a lot of pleasure from command and is both power hungry and domineering for its own sake. Memory extraction indicates she feels guilty about this fact. She believes she values honor and glory above life, but she is not as courageous as she thinks she is and suffers frequent nightmares depicting her own death. The two most frequent dream subjects are being eaten alive or being captured by enemies and subjected to torture.

**Information Report**:
Note: The information recovered from analysis of her mind was cross referenced with the information gathered from subjects D and F (see Archive 9 Section 2.B for further information) in order to verify for accuracy. 

The subject confirms our insight that the imperial control of [[The Centerlands]] is weak and the conquering armies are splint between three legions advancing across [[Alos]] in the south and two armies reconquering the rebellious provinces of the west. The rest of the armies appear to be scattered across [[The Rent]], the [[Tenevier Pass]], and [[Ardakan]] (locations unknown). The total strength across all the armies appears to be two hundred thousand standing. Although the total martial strength of the Empire when all forces are marshalled appears to be in the order of 1 to 2 million fighting men. The current strength of [[the Expeditionary Force]] is five thousand, although she believes that if [[Velen]] is victorious in [[Alos]] he will bring the legions of the south to [[Delos]].

She confirmed to us that The Empire’s productive capacity is maintained by the extraction of [[Kestrel|Theradite]] (often simply called powder or red salt) by slaves in the ice sheets in the north. It is believed by the
members of the senior officer corps that supplies will not last more than a few centuries, although this information is known only to the Emperor himself.

We have also learned from her how their leaders are chosen. The imperial throne is non-hereditary and the Emperor is obligated by law to appoint a junior co-Emperor by their sixtieth year. The elected officer
is then stripped of their family name and subjected to sterilization to prevent them from bearing children. The Imperial Scepter (See Archive 9 Section 2.C for what we have learned of the artifact Tyranny), granting control of the Knights of the Black Rose and the Imperial Eyes is passed on upon death or the Emperor reaching 80 years of age, whichever comes first.

## Appendix A: Problems with Memory Extraction

The subject showed considerable distress during the process of memory extraction. Two lab aids were critically injured after she managed to escape the restraints. Pacification and punishment inflicted severe psychic stress resulting in difficulties with memory extraction. Information retrieved may be inaccurate.

## Appendix B: Recommendations for Action

Should it be necessary that to take action to delay or otherwise obstruct the Netherese forces I recommend the subject be released and be given provision to return to [[Base 17]]. It Is likely that she would cause problems amongst the advancing army, including potential mutiny and insurrection.

If this is judged unnecessary it is recommended that she be used in the testing of [[Project 9]]. The officers of the Expeditionary Force are subjected to training to prepare them to resist delusion and magic derangement. We suggest probing the limits of this ability.
