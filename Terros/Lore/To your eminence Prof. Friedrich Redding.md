To your eminence Prof. [[Friedrich Redding]],

Once again our diagram has proved its infinite wisdom. My spies in the lands south of [[Shara]] have reported the false-prince [[Lothair]]'s troops have crossed [[the River Brenick]] on the 5th of May. I think we can conclude they will indeed reach [[Fort James]] on the third or forth week of May. As we expected, [[Prof. Eidelberg]]'s seeing yielded truth - the [[Lady Vera]] accompanies them and she carries on her person a section of the [[Codex de Caelus]] Given that this was proved true, I think we can assume that it is indeed the section Of Motion. 

Furthermore, I have dispatched our agent, a woman named [[Anna de Heyda]], who I hold in very high esteem, to replace our fallen comrades in [[Illyria]]. Given that the city's fall should be immanent, I think we need someone on the scene.  Also, I recommend we give another student a chance at interpreting that section of the diagram. With I highest respect I must comment that our knowledge of the fall of Illyria is not in proportion to the magnitude of its importance. 

With great respect,

Elaida,

As I have said before - in [[Jena]] we do not recognize the difference between lordsman and servant, you needn't write with such formality, you have been elevated to the position of Master Mage for a reason. Now, I have just got a report from  the inquisitors in [[Fort James]] who have been questioning the man [[Marc]]. He works for the court wizard to the [[Queen Ilvana]] of [[Neverwinter]]. This man is, whose name I am told is [[Tameran Vacilio]], is in possession of a section of the [[Codex de Caelus]], though we do not as of yet believe he actually knows what it is or what to do with it.  I am sending some agents to find him and deal with him. We also do not believe that he possesses enough of it to be useful, though we are not sure on that detail. We are still a negative on finding the grave of the Wizard [[Eudoxus]] - all we have is that damned seeing from [[Kane]].

In other news, all the preparations are made for when [[Lothair|the Iron Prince]] and his armies arrive. That double-crossing, sightless coward will know his mistake. I do not know what His plans are, but [[Cassius Vecna|Vecna]]  has prepared [[Corvus]], so I think it will be something to remember. This will likely be your first taste of a true battle, but I  would not worry in the slightest, an enemy is always weakest when he thinks he has gained the upper hand. His men will be trapped where the think they are safest. 

One last thing, I will be returning to [[Jena]] from [[Caldaria]] on May 12th, leave your report for me and I can pick it up through the portal, as I think you'll have departed by that point. When you return though, we must meet and discuss strategy.

_The other papers are various spell scrolls. Some pages describing alchemical uses of substances you have never heard of. A long paper that looks to have something to do with triangles, though you're not sure if it is magical in nature or not. There are also some pages in a script that you do not recognize._
