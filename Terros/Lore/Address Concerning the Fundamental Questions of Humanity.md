# Address Concerning the Fundamental Questions of Humanity

The following speech was given by [[Empress Sophia]] during the opening of the [[University of Vedenberg]] to a group of scholars on the 11th of October 678, nearly three years after the return of [[Agathon]] bearing the Gifts of Sorcery and his crowning as Emperor

Today marks the official opening of this place of learning, and the day on which I name [[Ulrich van Telzberg]] as its first rector. It brings me great pleasure and honor to address these words to you. All of us can feel that at this moment, as we rebuild and heal from the great loss suffered afield, that a new life has come upon us. Once again we are blessed by the presence of our [[Casia|Goddess]], the sacred one who watches over us. She has given us new strength. The might of the heavens now flows through us, and a new time has come upon us. But what, I ask, is the mark of this new time?

I say that the age of petty politics has ended. Past are the days of pointless fighting, idle feuds, and fruitless wars. Under the heavenly banner of our God we stand together. This grants us great opportunities. Our strength of arms, now no longer born towards each other, can turn towards worthy targets. As our armies now unify, so too must our knowledge. Courage in the field must be matched by seriousness of research. We must press towards the questions of utmost importance for our Empire. What are these questions?

First, we must know our past. We know that we once lived like demons in the realm beyond. The Goddess healed our souls, and with her aid we constructed the ships of heaven and came to this
place. This presents many questions. This realm beyond, what is it? If passage here was possible, is passage back? Why did the Goddess choose to heal our souls? Did any remain behind?

None know either why the Goddess chose for us to come to this place. Why here and not somewhere else? And, now that we are here, what are we supposed to accomplish? What are we
to do?

With this, the question of our past becomes a question of our present situation. And there are few who could deny, on reflection, the uncanniness of our situation. We have been thrown into [[Delos|this world]]. But what this place is we cannot say. These few islands we call our home, tend to, and know, are only a small part of this vast place which still hides itself from us. All who have ventured forth cannot help but feel that behind every forest lies only a deeper jungle and behind every cave only another abyss.

Not only are these lands which we inhabit unknown to us, but they are hostile. All know this, but few question it. It is as if in what should be our own home we are intruders on enemy soil. There is no part of [[Lethair]] that does not try to keep us out.

This overwhelming danger demands our study. We must know more deeply the threats of this place. [[The Abyss Walker]], [[the Watcher of Saera]], [[the Preta]]. No power is known capable of even affecting such creatures. Can we, with the aid of the powers of sorcery granted to us by our revered mother, learn to match the powers of such immortal spirits? What else must we do to increase our strength?

The Goddess in her wisdom led us to this place, but this place rejects us. Why things are this way we do not know. But from this question we do not shrink back.

Here, I must remark. What we take as a question some take as an answer, as a sign for modesty. They cry that we who wish to push forward are guilty of hubris. The Goddess has allotted to us our small share of earth, and we should tend to it without complaint and spare no thought for the dreams of grander things or distant places. Such preachers of cowardice are wrong insofar as it was precisely our Goddess who granted us the drive to explore, the urge to press against the limits of what confronts us, and the means to do so. But they are right that we must exercise caution. If we do not know where we are heading our journey will be a disaster.

The question of our present situation thus passes over to the question of the future that awaits us, or what our fate is. We must take stock of both what might be coming and what future possibilities exist that we may seize. These questions are many. Do these few meager islands constitute our only dwelling place? Can we make further lands fit for our living? Are we to hang forever at the mercy of higher beings? Will they one day issue our destruction? Are we like insects waiting to be swatted? Can we do anything to prevent this? How?

The task of the University of Vedenberg and the Imperial Rangers is to answer these questions. This constitutes our service to this new nation.

Long live the Empire! May the Goddess bear witness and take pride in our future victories.


_The following handwritten note was folded along with the copy of the speech._

I am surprised you found this document. So few from the period survive. To think Sophia thought the age of petty politics had ended! If only it had. As you know I have had my head full of
[[Mordred Van Delzig|Mordred]]’s tomes over the past few weeks for research, and I will say this reads like he had a hand in it. It has his way about him.

To answer your first question, and her question as well, I would put my current thoughts on our origin as follows. First, I have finally decided against the thesis that we are descendants of elves. It is not impossible, but I find it much less plausible than I once did. My physiological investigations have revealed only more and more differences. And consider that if there were such a transition, it would either have to be immediate or mediated by a long process of gradual change. The latter I believe is very unlikely. If the transition was like the breeding of dogs, we should expect there to be intermediate stages, but no one has found any remains or any records of such a state. An immediate transition faces the problem of how such a thing could have come about. The only plausible candidates I see are either sorcery or the work of gods or demons. It could not have been sorcery, for the elves do not wield spells, only we do, and so that could not have been how we came into being. The latter I admit is still a possibility, though not one I know how to press further, other than to say, it could only have been a demon, or perhaps a very cruel god to have made us from elves. Elves are suited much better to life in this place. It could serve no beneficent purpose to have made us from the elves.

My other thesis was that we are descendants from voyagers across the dead sea. [[Adrian]]’s arrival proved very fortuitous here. He has aided me greatly through conversation. Now, I believe that
their history is truly older than ours, but it is hard to say how much is purely legendary (some of their stories and lineages go back many tens of thousands of years, but I am suspicious that any have truth to them). This makes our descent from them rather likely. But still we must ask where they came from. He tells me it is a common belief of his homeland that mankind was created in the image of another race who once guided them. This suggests to me a picture: there was once a race of powerful sorcerers, much more powerful than ourselves. They are the ones who fashioned the great ruins we explore and artifacts we gather. They made humanity (and perhaps elves) in
their image by sorcery. They have either left this place or died out. They left behind humans across the dead sea. These men voyaged to our islands. Perhaps the one we call the Goddess was a remaining member of the primordial race. Now the ones living across the dead sea have been wiped out, leaving only us behind. I have no account of what this primordial race could have been, but this story seems like it could be true to me.

As for your second question, I searched through all of the rangers archives. I have no idea, and I say this with some fear, what the “[[Watcher of Seara]]'' refers to. No information about this creature exists that I can access. How could no record exist for a creature that she names in the same breath as the Abyss Walker? Was the information lost when the library was burnt? It cannot have been lost coincidentally. It must have been destroyed. Either by [[Mordred Van Delzig|Mordred]], [[Ulrich]], or perhaps an unknown entity. What purpose that could have served I leave to speculation.
