[F#m]
Say barkeep, set a round of drink,
[Bm]			[F#m]
For drinking is our trade,
[F#m]
Tonight we’ll raise our glasses to
[C#]		     [F#m]
Whoever held a [[The Elder Blades|blade]]!
[D]		       [A]
For all  [[The Order of the Magi|the mages]] did for us,
[Bm]			[F#m]
A drink seems only fair.
[F#m]
But if they don’t show up tonight,
[C#]			    [F#m]
I guess I’ll drink their share!

[Chorus]
[D]			[A]
It’s a shame they’re elsewhere
[Bm]			    [F#m]
We even saved them a chair!
[F#m]
But their ten blades have all decayed,
[C#]				    [F#m]
So we guess we’ll drink their shares!


[[Aneius]] you’ll hope not to meet,
For [[Corvus]] he did wield,
That mage of death crafted a bomb,
And [[Corytha]]’s now a field
But the souls still passed through that [[the Black Gate|Black Gate]],
So a drink seems only fair,
But his inhumane change of terrain
Means I’ll have to drink his share!

[Chorus]

[[Ezrien]], the mage of nature,
With [[Lacerta]] he did quest
To find an elven bride to wed
Within the dark forest
And now the elves, they are our friends,
So a drink seems only fair,
But his newlywed, she turned up dead,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

[[Eudoxus]], he was geriatric,
Gods, he was a loon!
He took [[Cetus]] to outer space,
And made [[Arcterus|another moon]].
But now the night is brighter,
So a drink seems only fair,
But he can’t think nor much less drink,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]


[[Vitellius]] had a fire temper,
His heart and sword aflame,
[[Cygnus]] would sedate the God,
And give ol’ V his fame.
And because this hearth is warm,
A drink seems only fair,
But he’s in his den chatting with [[Ten]],
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

So take a trip to [[Alos]], 
There with [[Cephus]], you’ll find [[Nale]],
He advised the king with spellcasting,
They should have had him jailed.
But because the war is over,
A drink seems only fair,
But his lifestyle’s now “in exile,”
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

Oh [[Miran]], he’s an old sand flea,
Crafted with [[Caelum]] in hand.
He sailed across [[The Ceon Sea]],
So on [[Caeta]] he could stand.
And because he built our castles,
Well, a drink seems only fair,
But he’s down on the beach, eating a peach,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]


[[Lana]] held the Sword of Water,
Yes, [[Carina]] she did guide.
She caused great waves, too many graves,
And expanded the beachside!
But because the fish are biting,
A drink seems only fair,
But stuck is she, below the sea,
So I guess I’ll drink her share!

[Chorus]

That brings us to the Master Maker,
Oh [[Telam]] he was a foe!
With [[Tevas]] prime, the sword of time,
The Gods he’d overthrow!
And because we’re growing older,
A drink seems only fair,
But he’s still the vassal of [[Telam's Castle|a flying castle]],
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

Prince [[Henly]] was the Maker’s son,
A spoiled errand boy,
But he still reigned on [[The Winter Plane]]
[[Croxeor]] was no simple toy.
And the winter’s wrath was kind this year,
So a drink seems only fair,
And it’s a crime, he’s stuck back in time,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!


[Chorus]

Slick [[Casia]] was [[Telam]]’s right hand,
But still did wield no sword,
So she snuck inside his forge one night,
His warnings were ignored.
And because we all love magic,
A drink seems only fair,
But her one goal’s [[The World-Soul]],
So I guess I’ll drink her share!

[Chorus, but Slowed]
