## Lord [[Cadmus]],


We will have ten thousand men ready to eject the Northerners once the Kingâ€™s son is dead and the Snow is ours.  

The garrison at [[Caldea]] has no suspicion and we have confirmed that [[Telam]] is far across the Ocean; [[Aneius|Aveius]] and [[Casia]] have yet to return from [[Tel Dorac]].

The the other artifacts I am confident we can hold if you seize the blade.  

Best of luck,

[[Teaus]]
