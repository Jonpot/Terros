#monster

Name is Old Illyrian for good and true.

Come from [[Caeta|Telam's Gate]]. 

- Humans can become [[Tela Verii]] 
	- Pros: Bodies are attuned to work more effectively with mana, natural born spellcasters, baseline and peak abilities are much much much higher than humans, bodies can recover much faster than humans, and they can cast many more spells than humans before exhaustion. Physiology has also ironed out many of the deficiencies. Better perception and less health problems. Perfectly altruistic. They use sorcery over a long time to rebuild your body. Takes a few weeks to a few months. 5 people tried to convert in 3 days, only 1 lived. Itâ€™s done with spells or potions (especially for the longer transition). Spell is a ritual cast every day.
	- Cons: Must serve Tela Verii causes (depends on groups, 2-5 groups), not capable of knowing until later
- [[Len]] is one of the finittists. Infinity is not a real concept.
- Tela Verii can become [[Vampires]] 

- Consider putting sentient life into [[Damnation]] a terrible thing, so they are trying to free them.

- There are thousands of Tela Verii 
	- It requires a lot of mana to make a Tela Verii 
	- It may be dangerous to have a Tela Verii unbound to their oaths

- Aligned with [[Ishivan]], for the most part, who wishes to achieve the most peace and prosperity across the lands 

- Most of the Tela Verii would omnicide most species across the planes if they had the opportunity 
	- Don't consider humans, elves, demons, etc. as the most perfect form of life.
		- Because the number of planes that can be influenced are finite, they must go 

- Split into two major groups 
## The Finitists vs The Infinitists 
- Hinges on the plan to stop new gods from being born 
- As new gods will continuously be born, the influence of all entities on the universe will fade as new gods will rise and overpower the present entities 
- One proposed method of stopping Gods from being born is by freezing Time by sleeping or killing [[The God of Time]] 

# The Curse
- Cannot disagree with each other/the master of the [[Tela Verii]], was the first thing the first [[Tela Verii]]  did
