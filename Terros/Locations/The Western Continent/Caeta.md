## *Legend Lore* Reveals:
The smoke beings to change color, turning into an image. I can see a vision of [[the Ceon sea]], and a fleet of ships. At the front of one of the ships, [[Lana]] (Tall with blonde hair, holding [[Carina]] in one hand, in light leather armor), to her side is [[Miran]] (Shorter man with scraggily red hair, wearing white robes covering his skin, has his sand sword). Flash forward to making it across the sea. [[Miran]] is carving massive works of stone with [[Caelum|his blade]]- he makes [[Westfall]] with the other people from the boat. A few other other settlements are made, islands colonized, and people moving into and living on them. Many years pass. A single ship goes towards a land mass (Caeta), at the front of the ship is [[Cassia]] (a woman with blue robes and brown hair). Looks injured and sick, very weak.
