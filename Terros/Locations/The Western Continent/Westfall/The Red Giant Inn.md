A tavern/inn in [[Westfall]].

Once met a man in a suit:
- He has a paper filed with numbers
- He is a merchant for wool and clothing material
- He is suspicious of Journalists
    - Mentions “Imperial City” - this is [[Netheril]]
    - Thinks Westerners are weird
    - Clothing market might be good
    - Would rather be in the South - a city called [[Caldaria]]
        - The weather is beautiful there
        - Westfall early spring rains are bad (especially a big one 2 years ago), very cold in winter
