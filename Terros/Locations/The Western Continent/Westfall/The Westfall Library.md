A library beneath an estate in [[Westfall]]. Owned by [[Vasilis]] and [[Sevilla de Castelle]].

[[Theo Stonewall]] woke up in this library.

The library had some mysterious crates in it:
- Small Box 1:
    - Spell Scrolls and Books (1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells)
- Small Box 2:
    - A long sword (sharp blade, dull gray color, star for hilt)
- Small Box 3:
    - A helmet and gloves of a red plate armor. (Lost almost all luster)
- Big Box:
    - [[Euphorion]]
