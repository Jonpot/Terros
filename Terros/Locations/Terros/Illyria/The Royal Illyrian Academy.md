#building #location 

A cathedral-esque building in [[Illyria]] with a stone fence surrounding it. Replaced the Library/Tower of Illyria.

- The Library is inside, 5 crowns for access unless you’re a scholar (entrance exam or get a host (employer) or be an engineer/licensed artificer [not common, but everywhere in some capacity])
- Money changers here as well, could donate to the library via librarian
- The Lords’ Pavilion: the eastern side of the academy. A big dining pavilion in front of an outdoor theater.
	- [[Theo Stonewall]] watched "The White Lily" here.
