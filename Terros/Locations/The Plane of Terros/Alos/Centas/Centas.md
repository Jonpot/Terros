The Captial of [[Alos]].

- When arriving, the teleport dropped us in undercity slums. Horrible stench. People shoulder to shoulder.
- “The Almighty is Here, he sent an army of mages, we will swiftly defeat the empire” - Random Shopkeeper
- We head to [[The Grand Temple]]. We come out of [[Mount Yasha]]
- [[Telam's Castle]] is just in the Sky (A LOT BIGGER, MORE STRUCTURES, HUGE LANDMASS)


- The citadel has large metal spikes, covered in Southern runes. 4 soldiers clad in black armor standing outside the gates.
