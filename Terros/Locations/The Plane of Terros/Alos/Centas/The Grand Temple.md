The grand temple of [[Alos]], located in [[Centas]].

- The Temple is quite magnificent. Enormous. Massive dome painted in multiple colors. Gleaming in the open sun. Reflective like stained glass. People streaming in and out. Beautiful statues out front.
- We meet a man with Vestments (Golden yellow robes with embroidered flames).
- Rumors for "Who is the Forgemaster"?
	- [[The Almighty]] himself taking physical form
	- A demon here to trick us
	- Has 10 golden horses and brought down a meteor swarm on Illyria, he will defeat the Empire
	- He is [[Cassius Vecna|the lich king]] reborn, here to save us from his own creation
