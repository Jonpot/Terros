#location 

Very little is known about the World-Soul. This is where Telam channeled the God of Time to the material plane and subdued it as part of [[The Time War]].

- The location where [[The Plane of Ideas]] has the strongest connection [[the Prime Material Plane]] and where you can channel [[Ishivan]]'s power most strongly 
	- But not a planar gate, [[The Plane of Ideas]] isn't close enough

## *Legend Lore* Reveals:
- A fairly barren mountaintop
- A man in plain clothes in 40s or 50s
- Trudging up mountainside carrying a young child who is severely injured
- Walked to top of mountain, kneels on 1 knee, prays to sky
- *Scrying* reveals that this is a snowy mountaintop. No trees. Heavy snowstorm. Another smaller peak in the distance. It is currently daytime (when in [[Westfall]] it was 10 or 11 AM, in [[Illyria]] it’s Midnight).


## [[Tela Verii]]
The Tela Veri claim that it's where the dying God of Magic, [[Ishivan]], resides. It exists at the north pole of [[Terros]].
