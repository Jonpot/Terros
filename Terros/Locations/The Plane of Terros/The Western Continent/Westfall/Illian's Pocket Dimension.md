#location 

[[Illian Everguard|Illian]] maintains a pocket dimension hidden from Scrying magic in his room. It is a good place to get work done in secret, and it's where he is developing his phylactery.

There is a big map of the entire known world here, as well as a board pinned full of papers. Illian also keeps a clone of himself here that can do benign tasks and chores while Illian is away.

A locked door which bars entry to his phylactery.
