#monster 

## *Legend Lore* Reveals:
Part of a savage tribe that worship the storms. "[[The Lady of Storms]]." The witches and warlocks convert people into these bird creatures. All the bird people go to [[Caeta]]. 
- First flash: [[Lana]] is standing next to [[Casia]] and a man in Armor and a black fur coat, with curly black hair and pale skin ([[Aneius]]). He has his sword. There is a heavy rain, as the three talk by an outcropping. 
- Second flash: a mountainside with three people are performing a ritual. A star forms above, shifting between blue, red, yellow, white. They look up at the sky, then back down. There is a person on the ground. The star moves into the person. The person shouts. A time lapse as the person transforms into a harpy. The creature takes flight into the night. The second moon of Terros has not been formed yet. The creature is flying into the far north. Our three mages ([[Lana]], [[Casia]] , and [[Aneius]] ) are now involved in a brutal combat. Many (20-30) dead harpies are by their side. Smashed stone golems as well. A storm is raging around them. The fight has just ended.
