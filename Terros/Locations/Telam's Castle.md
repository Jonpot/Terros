A floating castle once owned by the mage [[Telam]].

Now floating over [[Centas]], occupied by a mysterious man who claims to be "The Forgemaster", who is helping the church.


## *Legend Lore* Reveals:
- Scene shifts to a castle floating in the sky
- Very dark, the sun is setting
- A sea of tents below, full of lights, on a coastline (not recognized)
- Spellcasting coming from within, several spellcasters, beautiful voices (very skilled)
- Bright light coming from within, a crash, vision fades
