The connects to the travel point of [[The House of Shadow]].

After Tela Verii fled Terros, they made more of themselves, then came to find the colonies of Vecna to influence them to be good. The Demons knew the Tela Verii would become the strongest. The demons acted "with vile behavior"- every kind imaginable. There are very few demons, they can't naturally reproduce and don't have a internal labor force. They enslave millions.  The Vampires raise humanoid livestock. Alliance between Vampires and Demons. Aside from [[the prime material plane]] (Terros), the other planes are the incarnation of the will of one or more demons. The plane and the demon are more or less aspects of the same thing. They don't know where Terros came from. Part of what happens in the outer planes is reflected in Terros. For example, suppose on the plane of water the seas are in chaos, there would also be chaos in the seas of Terros. Causality is unclear. "God" is a human term, Tela Verii think in terms of major and minor demons. Minor demons have planes in a state of flux. Gods are major demons who have stable planes. It's not impossible for a human to do. Humans are a kind of lesser demon. The God of Death created humans. Mana for magic comes from a plane. They only want to kill the "bad" demons.

Telam was trying to fulfill Ishivan's request to capture all the Gods and bring them under his control. 

The Tela Verii killed Telam because of internal conflict.

The Netherese killed Vecna. They had betrayed Vecna to work with Telam, and then shortly betrayed Telam. Most Tela Verii at the time did not think Vecna was extreme or radical enough. Now it's 65% of the voting block. They are getting weaker over time.

- Plane of Nature vampires are not allied with any large vampire factions. There are a few vampire lords. The Tela Verii will likely get to them first.
