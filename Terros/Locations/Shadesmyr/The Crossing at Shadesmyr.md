Populated by a lot of [[Tela Verii]] 

Had been built for them while in their human form. The most human-like, unlike other Tela Verii settlements which are more strange. A lot of the Tela Verii have left because they're being used for the War with [[The House of Shadow]].

500,000 humans.

There is a riot here because:

the humans skirmish with the demons on this plane. 100 years ago the [[Tela Verii]] helped the humans fight off the demons in exchange for their support. The Demons here come from a plane called [[Shadesmyr]]. Tela Verii need access there and this is one of them, because they have been blocked from teleporting directly, so they need to use a crossing. The Tela Verii can permanently severe the connection, which the humans want, and didn't know the Tela Verii could do, so they're upset.

The Humans here were originally a Vecna Nucleus Force. This is the 3rd Army.
