	- I am now Julius Acosta
	- Accompany her unit to go into [[The Dark Forest]]  because I was good at mind reading and mind alteration
- Quartermaster Hoffman
	- [[Kestrel]] on the other side in the hands of [[The House of Shadow]]s
	- Pieces of offensive weaponry, Glyphs of Warding, Antimagic Fields, Power Armor, "The Drugs" (Green, Red, Courage)
		- Courage - liquid courage, kills emotions like fear- DON'T TAKE TOO MUCH, WILL FRY BRAIN 
			- There are BRAIN DISEASES?!? Main one is caused by too much courage 
			- Not more than 3 in a week
			- Lasts 1 hours
		- Green - Enhanced reaction time, enhanced senses
		- Red - Healing Magic (Immediate healing and induces body repair processes to accelerate. Also very relaxing. Builds muscle overtime.)
			- Only be aware of long term usage, lasts 4 hours
			- Very expensive
			- Long term might be _really bad_
		- Eating Kestrel is highly toxic
	- We are working with 8 Headed Spiders 
	- We're about to go to war with the [[Tela Verii]] 
		- The [[Tela Verii]] have been bringing over the Sarician that were pushed off plane as well as their other human allies. 
- Isabel gives me a pocketwatch
	- [[The Dark Forest]] is in almost perfect alignment 
	- Shows time here, shows time in forest, also a stopwatch 
	- Isabel is from Southgard 
	- The Dark Forest  has demons that can modify memories
		- **1573 IS THE CODE**
	- "Never go anywhere alone"
	- Say your name, place of birth, one other fact, why you're here, and the code 
		- My fake parents: Loretta and Bob
	- Isabel's mother's name was Casillia 
		- Acacian is from [[Corytha]]  and his father's name is Lambert
	- Should only stay for a few days
- CROSSING INTO [[The Dark Forest]] 
- Going to the Prisons, not many here, mostly evacuated
	- Human in grey robes: Patyura
		- A Sarician that was captured 
		- Hoping to make more friendly contact
		- Afraid Tela Verii have put mental modifications on the Saricians that will kill the Saricians if I press too hard
		- Isabel will be very upset if the Sarician is killed 
		- Late 20s
		- Curly brown hair
		- Tan skin 
		- Square face, hardy guy 
		- From Castalia
		- Speaks Illyrian in a modern accent 
		- Thinks seventh army are weakling pacifists
			- long given up warmongering ways 
		- "coexistence with demons is impossible"
		- Prime Material Plane belongs to [[Tela Verii]] 
		- Refers to Dark Forest as a Planet 
		- "The greater part of humanity is not responsible for the decisions of their government"
		- Thinks they are very close to taking the plane 
		- Fucking entrenched in sunk cost fallacy
		- They are going to try to force the Tela Verii to bring [[Vespa]] and [[Carina]] to [[The Dark Forest]] 
			- The Tela Verii made a new weapon with the vast amounts of Mana they have and they are going to use it to Destroy to Eight Headed Spider
	- Saricians 
		- Lived here since Vecna first sent people here 
		- Live far from the Demons 
		- They've been supplementing with humans from other planes perhaps 
		- Know they are very allied with [[Tela Verii]] 
			- This has made them far more militarized
		- Need to know their numbers, capabilities, and what they can do without spellcasting
			- ALL SPELLCASTING IS GOING TO STOP IN THE DARK FOREST IN A FEW DAYS
				- Has been cooked up with [[The Eight Headed Spider]] 
					- Will last "quite a while" 
				- There are very ancient humans that came here before Terrans (before spellcasting existed on the material plane)
					- Maybe taught Saricians how to use Demonic magic that won't be effected by the embargo 
						- Conjure Power of Ancient Devils
							- What destroyed the forgotten kingdom, the prince learned how to use the magic of the God of Nothingness
					- The Forgotten Kingdom
						- The Prince of Nothingness (of the Forgotten Kingdom) also used the magic of the Devil of the Unseen 
						- The people of the kingdom all disappeared 
				- Also want to know general sentiments 
					- We have a guarantee of safety for all humans across planes before demons can purge them, which the Netherese are willing to extend that 
						- Need to know how many live off plane 
					- Do they want to come back to Material Plane?
					- Incept this idea into him.
	- Can silence the sound
	- Doing checks to make sure Tela Verii can't prophesize what's going to happen here
- Guy in Power Armor - Kesh
- Every 171 Hours the Forest Sparkles
	- No demons conjuring it
	- No magic casting it
	- It's just like that 
	- Lasts exactly 53 minutes 
	- Only living organisms can see it, constructs can't detect it 
- Elevator cycles between 5 sites, Prison is Site C, stays on a site for a few hours 
	- Even if the plane is in alignment it will go to a random place, but less likely
- **DON'T USE SENDING**
- [[Tela Verii]] 
- Saricians were the first force sent before [[The Seventh Army]] 
	- First humans since [[Telam]]
