# Corvus, Sword of Death 
Sword of Nul, Death, and the Void. Golden handle and hilt with black raven as a pommel. The blade is straight and silver. 

One of [[The Elder Blades]].

Previously held by [[Aneius]].

Previously held by [[Cassius Vecna]], used to channel the God of Death and bring destruction to all of [[Terros]].

Currently, Corvus is perhaps not taken by Empire, instead perhaps taken by Vecna’s Troops.
