Sword of Nul, Death, and the Void. Golden handle and hilt with black raven as a pommel. The blade is straight and silver. 

Melancholic and quiet

One of [[The Elder Blades]].

Previously held by [[Aneius]].

Currently, Corvus is perhaps not taken by Empire, instead perhaps taken by Vecnaâ€™s Troops.
