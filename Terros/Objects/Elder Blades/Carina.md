## Conversations
- [[Lana]] was away from the rest of the magi very often. Very good friends with [[Casia]]. Fought in [[The Time War]].

After [[Eveth Blackwater|Eveth Blackstar]], she went into the Sea.

Wild Hunt: Led by [[Ezrien]], who was the best friend of [[Lana]].

[[Ezrien]] hated the Ocean and sailing.

Lana admired the elves.

After the war, [[Telam]] went away. Came here to [[Caeta]] to work on something. All the mages but Lana left, until eventually Carina left too, leaving Lana behind. They were waiting for [[Nale]], but he never came. [[Casia]] did something, but Carina can't remember why.
