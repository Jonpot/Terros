- A person wearing the rest of the armor. Gray black hair. Unrotted, doesn’t appear to be dead. Maybe sequestered?
- It’s a man in his 30s, his eyes are closed. Ethnically Illyrian, or just Eastern.
- Detect thoughts work. A battlefield, guy on horseback, charging. The battle is ending, he is turning to run, something is chasing him. Deep fear.
    - Messaging reveals he’s alive. He is from [[Illyria]]. Serves [[Xaira]]. Hisses with rage and then laughs at mention of “[[Cassius Vecna]]” and “honorable man.” Been in battle for “eons” “two years on campaign.”
    - Says “I serve house [[Blackstar]]”
    - “I am hurt”
    - “I am dead”
    - Taking armor off, there is a big gash on his chest.
    - Blood is black.
    - “I am awaiting orders.”
    - “I do not know a [[Marceyan Blackstar]].”
    - “[[Ishivan]] is my enemy, I do not know”
    - “Mages bound me. You must help me, I want to be awake.”
    - “I am Euphorian- - Captain” (Legend Lore reveals _nothing_)
    - “I am asleep. Awaiting orders. Am stuck.”
    - “I serve [[Viscera Blackstar]].”
    - “Theo Stonewall was a man. Alive? Dead? I don’t know.”
    - “I served Xeira once, in a way. Euphorion did.”
    - “I saw a blue star in the sky once with Viscera.”
    - “Fighting horsemen on the ‘ethere’ plane. We were tricked- I don’t know. I must run. We are being pursued.”

- Day 2 (This time with Zone of Truth)
    - “My name is Euphorion”
    - “I am a servant of the Empress”
    - “The Empress [[Xaira]] and I serve loyally.”
    - “I was slain on the field of battle.”
    - “He was very fast, I do not know where he came from.”
    - “He took the form of one of my men to trick me.”
    - “My men are loyal to the grave (I was not betrayed)”
    - “[[Viscera Blackstar]] is the witch who trapped me, she is my enemy and my master.”
    - “The witch did not take my heart.”
    - “I had my heart taken and was saved by compassion.”
    - “No, I am stuck.”
    - “I am no mage.”
    - “No antimagic could kill me.”

### Finally Released from Curse with the help of an Antimagic Field

- Euphorion was from [[Westfall]] 300 years ago with [[Viscera Blackstar]]
- He hates mages
- “The terms of our contract were about to expire and I was going to leave her- so she trapped me in the cellar”
- “Us devils are not allowed to break our contracts.”
- What plane? “I was here before you all showed up.”
- “I do not know who made the first humans. It wasn’t important at the time. I had been dead at that point.”
- “Being dead is unpleasant. [[The Master of the House of Shadows]] does not like devils very much”
- “Humans were much a nuisance until they learned to cast spells and make metal weapons.”
- What do you want? “That’s an interesting question. What is desire? I think I’d like some food.”
- “[[Cassius Vecna]] was mostly interested in killing devils and demons- most likely because of the trouble we caused him”
- “Devils are us who have been bound by the tyrant and must follow its rules.”
- “[[The Tyrant]] was the first devil and the one who conquered the realm of demons”
- “You did not hold the Tyrant, perhaps a fragment of his memories”
- “There are perhaps three entities that demons fear, and [[The Tyrant]] is feared most of all”
- “[[The Master of the House of Shadows]] and [[The Eight Headed Spider]] are the others”
- _Powerful, not omnipotent_
- Wants a house with 1000 servants. Can take lifespan. Loosely interested in gold. Uninterested in magical services. Says politics don’t matter.
- “A devil cannot break his promises.”
- We could get a word of power that for the next 6 months that would let us summon him.
