She spent most of childhood in the city of [[Caldaria]] with brief stays in imperial outposts in the Hinterlands (Reference unknown). Beginning age 12 she was educated at the Academy for Young Officers before moving to the Imperial University Officer School age 15, where based on performance she was inducted into the Imperial Court.

She took part in her first campaign in 904, joining the army of the Imperial Second Velen against [[The Holy League]] (Reference unknown). After two years she had been promoted to the rank of Captain and took part in the conquest of the Holy City of Centas in 906. She fled the city three months later after rebellion by the natives resulted in the massacre of most of the troops stationed. Memory indicates she escaped by hiding in the cart of a deaf merchant leaving the city. 

She took part in the pacification of the rebellion. Her memory indicates the city was destroyed (note: memory analysis was hindered by extremity of emotions; details were unable to be extracted). For services rendered she was granted her request to join the expeditionary force, leaving Terros in 908, age 21.
