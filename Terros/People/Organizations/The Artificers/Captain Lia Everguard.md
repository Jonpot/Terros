[[Illian Everguard]]'s sister. One of [[The Artificers]].

> Two nights ago we suffered an attack on the Warpcamp at [[Caeta|Telamâ€™s Gate]]. The enemies attacked without warning and the defenders were overcome. 2,000 soldiers were killed, along with the 10,000 members of the civilian population. The one responsible for the attack was the leader of the [[Tela Verii]], a people who had made a pact of peace with us ten years ago when first encountered by our late [[Emperor Caius]]. The main weapon in the attack was a powerful demon unleased by our enemies.
> Concurrent with the attack on the expeditionary force, the soldiers of [[The Holy League]] crossed [[the Sontar river]] and attacked our positions along the riverbank, pushing our defenders north out of the Sontar valley along with attacks along the eastern frontier from the city of [[Celast]]. The sorcerer responsible for killing our beloved Emperor Caius was released from captivity there.
> It is a dark day for our nation. We have suffered many loses. But our resolve is firm. Our enemies have rejected all attempts at peace forced us into conflict. The Senate has hearby made a declaration of war against the Tela Verii, the Holy League, and all their allies. The crimes committed against our nation will be payed for twice over in blood, and we will not rest until both the leader of the Tela Verii and the Church have been punished for their injustices.
