# Interview with [[Nale]] 
- Guy in jungle was actually him
- A Light Book exists
- Brought himself to the prison to heal the prisoners
- Running out of energy, considers healing spells a burden and ready to give up
- First to attempt healing magic- insurmountably difficult to specify the healed state of the human body in the language of magic 
- When a priest or someone wielding demonic power casts a spell, they are just a conduit. [[Ishivan]], on the other hand, has actually taught people how to access the power themselves. He doesn't mediate the spell at all.
- Whatever [[Ishivan]] tells you is in service of his war against all Evil 
	- Ishivan prefers Humans to all other life, but humans do not represent the best possible form of life 
- Nale keeps the other Magi alive
	- [[Aneius]] left the material plane 
- Tower of Ascension
	- Lana found it 
		- She was the one interested in reaching the top 
			- She was an explorer above all else
		- She believed it was the domain of the Elder God, told to her by Demons, but demons tell many lies 
	- Predates the existence of humans 
- Has illusion abilities he got from Demons a long time ago
	- Becomes totally and completely unseen 
	- Cannot be seen by Gods 
	- Cannot be predicted by forecasting magic 
	- Given to him by The Devil of the Unseen 
		- Only findable via the Devil of Knowledge 
			- Likes to tell people things they don't want to know
			- The Devil of the Unseen and all others that possess his ability can see each other 
			- The Humans that have inhabited that land had worked out a powerful form of demonic magic and survive in [[The Dark Forest]]. Artifacts let them channel their strength.
			- His face is the last person he devoured the memories of 
			- Once you've made eye contact, if you break eye contact, he devours your memories 
- The Magi 
	- His closest friends, closer than family.
	- [[Telam]] was working for Ishivan and cared not for Humanity, the greatest disappointment 
	- [[Casia]] knows that Devils can't lie, but they can still be deceptive. One common tactic is deleting their own memories so they can lie without knowing it 
- The Lord of Light 
	- Will fall into [[Damnation]] and be devoured soon 
		- Nale has a piece of the Lord of Light's heart 
			- He hears the howls of the Void creatures at all times. It is unbearable 
			- **BARDS DON'T SPELLCAST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE???? ASK THE DEVIL OF KNOWLEDGE.**
	- [[The House of Shadow]] brought the Lord of Light to the pit of [[Damnation]] a long time ago, but has been suspended just above it by allies until now.
- [[The House of Shadow]] 
	- Just self-preservation. They believe the Lord of Light will lead a war against them and free creatures in [[Damnation]]. 
	- Before the House of Shadows there were cruel leaders called The Ancient Ones. The House of Shadows claims they must never be freed.
- Learned to not have regrets 
- Greatest Fear: Tela Verii believe planes will come to an end and all existence will cease. He doesn't want life in the planes to come to and end.
