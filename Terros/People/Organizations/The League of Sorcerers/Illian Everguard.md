#person #human #mage #the-league-of-sorcerers

Clean shaven, short black hair. Normal looking. Tall.

A capable mage. Intends to take over [[The Empire]].

Told [[Theo Stonewall|Theo]] “Don’t say Tevas out loud.” and that "[[Titus]] is a friend, but he does not know about my spellcasting."

Is an Engineer of [[The Empire]].

Controls [[The League of Sorcerers]].

Has studied [[Cassius Vecna]]'s diagram and it led him to awakening [[Theo Stonewall]].  He stole this portion of the diagram from [[Centas]]. In his portion of the diagram, there are some runes. *Legend Lore* reveals they are "A fragment of the word of truth for time in need".

Wants to prioritize getting the blades, in particular the [[Codex de Gnosis]] and [[Vespa]].

## Lore from Illian:
- [[Cassius Vecna|The Lich King]] was defeated. The accounts show he was killed. The army of the dead and the rest of his minions were pushed to [[Caeta|Telam's Gate]] where they darkened the sky. The last of his minions fled and vowed to take vengeance. - [[Illian Everguard]] 
- Doesn’t know where the other mages are. [[Casia]] is still alive somewhere. [[Telam]] is dead.
- [[Illyria]]  fell to [[The Empire]]. The Empire controls the entirety of [[Terros]], all of the Western Continent, the top half of [[Alos]], and [[Qhana]].
- The [[Tela Verii]] are not human. Not bird people. Not from this world, come from [[Caeta|Telam's Gate]].
