#lore #organization 

A group of 12 mages (not including [[Theo Stonewall]] or [[Tameran Vacilio]]) organized by [[Illian Everguard|Illian]] as a resistance to [[The Empire]].

- More mages are involved peripherally
- Mages are stationed both in and out of the Empire
- There is a fake mage (Codename X) who the Empire believes is working for the League
- Some mages comparable to Illian and Theo, some considerably weaker
- Some artifacts, but these are kept secret
- They only have 3 years to be successful:
	- After [[Emperor Caius|the emperor]] died, no one can legally change the order of succession except the minister of justice (who is also dead). Illian controls the person who can appoint a new minister of justice, but they will be up for reappointment in 3 years, after which Illian may no longer control them.
