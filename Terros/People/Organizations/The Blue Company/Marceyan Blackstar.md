From a very long time ago.

Potentially related to Vecna, but not his brother. 

Conquered modern day [[Cormyr]] and [[Netheril]], bringing it into the Illyrian empire. Got the name [[Blackstar]] because he knew a lot about astrology, particularly that an eclipse was coming, and attacked some barbarian armies in the west who unified against the encroaching Illyrians during the eclipse with fire magic. He was named warden of the west, ruled from [[Westgard]], which was west of Netheril- currently underwater.
