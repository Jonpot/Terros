Once wielded [[Corvus]].

## Young Vecna:
Perhaps teenagers, the oldest maybe 20. Traveled in a band of three, accompanied by his wife, the Empress [[Xaira]], and the Achon of Ademon and the founder of the Church of Death, [[Diosophanes]].

The group traveled to [[The Pale|Attica]] [Modern day Pale] to search out the wisdom of a sage. Learned magic and reason there.

At the height of the empire, Vecna had just slain [[the Dragon of Ilgrove]] when he had returned to the castle of the Governor of [[Northumbria]] for rest. Here he had his vision that the empire would fall, and the Realm was doomed to tyranny and chaos.

When he told the Achon Diosophanes, he was declared as opposed to the Father of Mankind, after which there was a duel resulting in the death of the Achon and significant damage to the city.

After this, he journeyed north to make the diagram and found [[the University of Jena]].

## Present Vecna: 
A man, of average height, with long black hair. He has a gaunt face, his eyes sort of hollow, like he is straining to see. His left hand is missing and his right arm is clearly bandaged.

Vecna is a title. By birth he was named Cassius. In [[the Northern Realms]] he was called Mazrim. In the Illyrian Imperial Province of Northumbria, which included what is today the Northern Realms, the adjunct [representative, second in command] to the Empress was hailed by the name of Mazrim after he slew a dragon, in honor of the old king Mazrim, who was called the Dragon of the North.

The war between [[Netheril]], [[Cormyr]], and the Northern Realms was entirely the responsibility of the agents of the[[ Prince Lothair]], not Vecna.

Vibed with Gotts Chalk in a box for a while.
