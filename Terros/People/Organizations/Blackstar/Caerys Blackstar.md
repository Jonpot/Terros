From a very long time ago, around 284.

An easterner, brought [[The Order of the Red Rose]] to [[Netheril]]. Known for her good work with [[Emperor Maximilian]]. Brought dozens of ships, thousands of people, West to [[Caeta]]. Wouldn't explain why- but kept saying it was very important. Persuaded Maximilian to give her the ships and men to find it. Halfway through the journey they encountered massive storms, veering South to the Southern Pole, when they found the ruined city of [[Westfall]], and began to restore it. Eventually died in battle with a group of fishermen to the North called the [[Vith]]. Battle was over land.
