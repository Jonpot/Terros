May be a pseudonym for [[Ishivan]].

The God of [[Westfall]]. (The God of God). All of this comes from [[The Order of the Red Rose]], the first gods were that of [[The God of Time]] and [[The God of Space]], more gods rose, the developments of the original two. Gods of change, substance, motion, etc. Each God was not exactly complete- kept needing to advance to a higher stage. [[The God of Nature]], supplanted by [[The God of Death]] with the development of humankind. Veysan is the God of Civilization, Industry, and Knowledge. Moved them from the primitive state, and completing the cycle of the God.


The name of an alliance between Ishivan and other gods
