100 Miles north of [[Telam's Castle]] on [[The Plane of Nature]].

- People kept alive inside of the walls, they are afraid of Death, kept alive here by the God.
- The God will accept large beasts as sacrifices for favors.

- Not pleasant to interact with
- Amoral
- Monstrous
- Cruel, indifferent, and wasteful beyond measure
- Chaotic, vengeance against any who wrong it
	- Perhaps dislikes [[The God of Death]] because it is opposed to life
