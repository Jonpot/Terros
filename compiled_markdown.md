# Address Concerning the Fundamental Questions of Humanity

The following speech was given by [[Empress Sophia]] during the opening of the [[University of Vedenberg]] to a group of scholars on the 11th of October 678, nearly three years after the return of [[Agathon]] bearing the Gifts of Sorcery and his crowning as Emperor

Today marks the official opening of this place of learning, and the day on which I name [[Ulrich van Telzberg]] as its first rector. It brings me great pleasure and honor to address these words to you. All of us can feel that at this moment, as we rebuild and heal from the great loss suffered afield, that a new life has come upon us. Once again we are blessed by the presence of our [[Casia|Goddess]], the sacred one who watches over us. She has given us new strength. The might of the heavens now flows through us, and a new time has come upon us. But what, I ask, is the mark of this new time?

I say that the age of petty politics has ended. Past are the days of pointless fighting, idle feuds, and fruitless wars. Under the heavenly banner of our God we stand together. This grants us great opportunities. Our strength of arms, now no longer born towards each other, can turn towards worthy targets. As our armies now unify, so too must our knowledge. Courage in the field must be matched by seriousness of research. We must press towards the questions of utmost importance for our Empire. What are these questions?

First, we must know our past. We know that we once lived like demons in the realm beyond. The Goddess healed our souls, and with her aid we constructed the ships of heaven and came to this
place. This presents many questions. This realm beyond, what is it? If passage here was possible, is passage back? Why did the Goddess choose to heal our souls? Did any remain behind?

None know either why the Goddess chose for us to come to this place. Why here and not somewhere else? And, now that we are here, what are we supposed to accomplish? What are we
to do?

With this, the question of our past becomes a question of our present situation. And there are few who could deny, on reflection, the uncanniness of our situation. We have been thrown into [[Delos|this world]]. But what this place is we cannot say. These few islands we call our home, tend to, and know, are only a small part of this vast place which still hides itself from us. All who have ventured forth cannot help but feel that behind every forest lies only a deeper jungle and behind every cave only another abyss.

Not only are these lands which we inhabit unknown to us, but they are hostile. All know this, but few question it. It is as if in what should be our own home we are intruders on enemy soil. There is no part of [[Lethair]] that does not try to keep us out.

This overwhelming danger demands our study. We must know more deeply the threats of this place. [[The Abyss Walker]], [[the Watcher of Saera]], [[the Preta]]. No power is known capable of even affecting such creatures. Can we, with the aid of the powers of sorcery granted to us by our revered mother, learn to match the powers of such immortal spirits? What else must we do to increase our strength?

The Goddess in her wisdom led us to this place, but this place rejects us. Why things are this way we do not know. But from this question we do not shrink back.

Here, I must remark. What we take as a question some take as an answer, as a sign for modesty. They cry that we who wish to push forward are guilty of hubris. The Goddess has allotted to us our small share of earth, and we should tend to it without complaint and spare no thought for the dreams of grander things or distant places. Such preachers of cowardice are wrong insofar as it was precisely our Goddess who granted us the drive to explore, the urge to press against the limits of what confronts us, and the means to do so. But they are right that we must exercise caution. If we do not know where we are heading our journey will be a disaster.

The question of our present situation thus passes over to the question of the future that awaits us, or what our fate is. We must take stock of both what might be coming and what future possibilities exist that we may seize. These questions are many. Do these few meager islands constitute our only dwelling place? Can we make further lands fit for our living? Are we to hang forever at the mercy of higher beings? Will they one day issue our destruction? Are we like insects waiting to be swatted? Can we do anything to prevent this? How?

The task of the University of Vedenberg and the Imperial Rangers is to answer these questions. This constitutes our service to this new nation.

Long live the Empire! May the Goddess bear witness and take pride in our future victories.


_The following handwritten note was folded along with the copy of the speech._

I am surprised you found this document. So few from the period survive. To think Sophia thought the age of petty politics had ended! If only it had. As you know I have had my head full of
[[Mordred Van Delzig|Mordred]]’s tomes over the past few weeks for research, and I will say this reads like he had a hand in it. It has his way about him.

To answer your first question, and her question as well, I would put my current thoughts on our origin as follows. First, I have finally decided against the thesis that we are descendants of elves. It is not impossible, but I find it much less plausible than I once did. My physiological investigations have revealed only more and more differences. And consider that if there were such a transition, it would either have to be immediate or mediated by a long process of gradual change. The latter I believe is very unlikely. If the transition was like the breeding of dogs, we should expect there to be intermediate stages, but no one has found any remains or any records of such a state. An immediate transition faces the problem of how such a thing could have come about. The only plausible candidates I see are either sorcery or the work of gods or demons. It could not have been sorcery, for the elves do not wield spells, only we do, and so that could not have been how we came into being. The latter I admit is still a possibility, though not one I know how to press further, other than to say, it could only have been a demon, or perhaps a very cruel god to have made us from elves. Elves are suited much better to life in this place. It could serve no beneficent purpose to have made us from the elves.

My other thesis was that we are descendants from voyagers across the dead sea. [[Adrian]]’s arrival proved very fortuitous here. He has aided me greatly through conversation. Now, I believe that
their history is truly older than ours, but it is hard to say how much is purely legendary (some of their stories and lineages go back many tens of thousands of years, but I am suspicious that any have truth to them). This makes our descent from them rather likely. But still we must ask where they came from. He tells me it is a common belief of his homeland that mankind was created in the image of another race who once guided them. This suggests to me a picture: there was once a race of powerful sorcerers, much more powerful than ourselves. They are the ones who fashioned the great ruins we explore and artifacts we gather. They made humanity (and perhaps elves) in
their image by sorcery. They have either left this place or died out. They left behind humans across the dead sea. These men voyaged to our islands. Perhaps the one we call the Goddess was a remaining member of the primordial race. Now the ones living across the dead sea have been wiped out, leaving only us behind. I have no account of what this primordial race could have been, but this story seems like it could be true to me.

As for your second question, I searched through all of the rangers archives. I have no idea, and I say this with some fear, what the “[[Watcher of Seara]]'' refers to. No information about this creature exists that I can access. How could no record exist for a creature that she names in the same breath as the Abyss Walker? Was the information lost when the library was burnt? It cannot have been lost coincidentally. It must have been destroyed. Either by [[Mordred Van Delzig|Mordred]], [[Ulrich]], or perhaps an unknown entity. What purpose that could have served I leave to speculation.

# Appendix C: Rebellion in [[Illyria]]
The details we got from [[Isabel]]’s memory concerning the rebellion in Illyria were fragmentary, but accord with what we learned from our other subjects. 

The group known as [[the Illyrian Brotherhood]] began in the 870s under the leadership of [[Aran Tasleem]]. He was then provincial governor of the city. The movement was small, centered around a few members of ancient Illyrian noble lineage that had secured appointment in the administration and army. Their aim was the city’s liberation. In 887 their leader Aran disappeared and was replaced by his wife, a scholar and administrator named [[Helene]]. The brotherhood spent the next few years working their members into key posts, receiving funds from wealthy families, and manipulating supply lines to stockpile weapons and other munitions in the city. It was not until 895 that they had their moment arrived.

Ordinary imperial doctrine mandates that troops from a given province are stationed abroad so that loyalties will not be split, but heavy casualties in the war against [[The Holy League]] forced the seventh and ninth legions, composed of mostly Illyrians to be called back to Terros and stationed in Illyria to recover. Rebellion in the centerlands had disrupted grain production resulting in general unrest in the city.

On the 5th of April that year, an ex-Illyrian soldier who had been impoverished because of the famine, was arrested for stealing grain. It is an Imperial custom that those who work for the state are subject to more extreme punishment than civilians. Because he was a soldier the Imperial Justicar of the city had him burned alive. The citizens and soldiers flew into an outrage. An angry mob of citizens advanced on the courthouse. Helene and the officers of the brotherhood maneuvered the cities’ defenses out of their way so there was nothing to stop the crowd. They marched calling for the Justicar’s blood. When they reached the courthouse, with no other help, the Imperial Knights opened fire. Hundreds were slain. Helene and the other officers declared the Justicar and the other Imperial administrators guilty of violating the law and by emergency military edict declared themselves in charge of a provisional government until justice was done. A battle for control of the city then began. The Illyrian legions went over to the side of the brotherhood instead of defending the imperial governors and so the battle ended swiftly. The Netherese were either slain or fled the city. 

After a few days of violence the Netherese flag was taken down and replaced by an Illyrian rose signaling victory for the rebels. Helene and the Brotherhood convened an assembly and allowed all citizens to air grievances against the Empire. After a few days the assembly declared Helene the provisional governor and sent the Emperor a list of demands including a right to Illyrian self-rule. The Emperor did not send a response. He took command of the legions that prepared to recapture the city. By the middle of the summer the city was under siege by land and sea. The city, already suffering from a grain shortage, became desperate as the siege set in. The walls were too strong for artillery, but shots fired over them wrecked the city. Many in the rebellion’s inner circle had begun to think their plan a mistake, and begged Helene to surrender, but she refused, intent on victory. The officers in the brotherhood were resolute in their allegiance and so the rebellion continued and the city suffered.

The end came when [[Alexios]], Helene’s son and then only 13, went into his mother’s private chambers, allowed through by the guard. Isabel does not know the details of what happened between them, but it appears he slew her with a smuggled knife. Without her leadership, the rebellion came to an end. The faction in favor of surrender took over, the city’s gates were opened, and the rebels put to death.

The original leader of the rebels, long disappeared, was then outed as a member of the Speakers. So called because when the books of sorcery were destroyed, the mages who survived were reputed to have committed them all to memory and transmitted their contents orally. She doesn’t know anything about his wherabouts.

The garrison at [[Caldea]] has no suspicion and we have confirmed that [[Telam]] is far across the Ocean; [[Aneius|Aveius]] and [[Casia]] have yet to return from [[Tel Dorac]].

# Subject: [[Isabel]] de Roya

**Completed**: Mental and Physical Report (Page 1), Information Report (Pages 1 and 2, also copied into the Index of Reports on the Netherese Empire)
**Incomplete**: Difficulties encountered in memory extraction, elaborated in Appendix A
**Recommendation**: Releasement (See Appendix B) or use in testing on Project 9
**Biographic Details**: Born on the 5th of the 11th Month in the Year 887. Calendar Conversion Unknown. Age 26. She was born in [[Netheril|the Imperial City]] to the family De Roya of the 7th Rank. She spent most of childhood in the city of [[Caldaria]] with brief stays in imperial outposts in the Hinterlands (Reference unknown). Beginning age 12 she was educated at the Academy for Young Officers before moving to the Imperial University Officer School age 15, where based on performance she was inducted into the Imperial Court.

She took part in her first campaign in 904, joining the army of the Imperial Second Velen against [[The Holy League]] (Reference unknown). After two years she had been promoted to the rank of Captain and took part in the conquest of the Holy City of Centas in 906. She fled the city three months later after rebellion by the natives resulted in the massacre of most of the troops stationed. Memory indicates she escaped by hiding in the cart of a deaf merchant leaving the city. 

She took part in the pacification of the rebellion. Her memory indicates the city was destroyed (note: memory analysis was hindered by extremity of emotions; details were unable to be extracted). For services rendered she was granted her request to join the expeditionary force, leaving Terros in 908, age 21.

After reaching Base 17 she took the troops under her command and crossed illegally to Delos in order to seek out and destroy [[Snowpoint Base]] and slay the one she believed to be [[Casia|the Goddess of Delos]]. She believed this would further her journey to assume the Imperial Throne. She was captured at the [[Lake Etria]] five weeks ago.

**Physical Report**:
She is five feet and seven inches tall with dark brown hair and brown eyes.
Her agility and reflexes are superior, with an extremely fast reaction time. Intense training regime since childhood has resulted in great cardiovascular strength and high endurance.
Note: she suffered serious injury on the left foot, primarily at the ankle. The wound never fully healed and has resulted in periodic pain inflammation and reduced dexterity on that side.

**Mental Report**:
Her mental faculties are above average but not extraordinary. She is capable of reasoning quickly under pressure, with an exceptional visual imagination and geographic memory, although her sense of her own abilities is inflated.

For her personality she is both extremely drive and possessed of a high degree of stamina. She is very sociable and grows irritated when she is subject to periods of solitude (note: subject appears unaware of this fact). She is both proud and possessed of a strong sense of honor and justice, although has difficulty controlling her anger and is often impulsive. She has suffered from a sense of inferiority since childhood. She doesn’t believe others sufficiently respect her abilities.

She derives a lot of pleasure from command and is both power hungry and domineering for its own sake. Memory extraction indicates she feels guilty about this fact. She believes she values honor and glory above life, but she is not as courageous as she thinks she is and suffers frequent nightmares depicting her own death. The two most frequent dream subjects are being eaten alive or being captured by enemies and subjected to torture.

**Information Report**:
Note: The information recovered from analysis of her mind was cross referenced with the information gathered from subjects D and F (see Archive 9 Section 2.B for further information) in order to verify for accuracy. 

The subject confirms our insight that the imperial control of [[The Centerlands]] is weak and the conquering armies are splint between three legions advancing across [[Alos]] in the south and two armies reconquering the rebellious provinces of the west. The rest of the armies appear to be scattered across [[The Rent]], the [[Tenevier Pass]], and [[Ardakan]] (locations unknown). The total strength across all the armies appears to be two hundred thousand standing. Although the total martial strength of the Empire when all forces are marshalled appears to be in the order of 1 to 2 million fighting men. The current strength of [[the Expeditionary Force]] is five thousand, although she believes that if [[Velen]] is victorious in [[Alos]] he will bring the legions of the south to [[Delos]].

She confirmed to us that The Empire’s productive capacity is maintained by the extraction of [[Kestrel|Theradite]] (often simply called powder or red salt) by slaves in the ice sheets in the north. It is believed by the
members of the senior officer corps that supplies will not last more than a few centuries, although this information is known only to the Emperor himself.

We have also learned from her how their leaders are chosen. The imperial throne is non-hereditary and the Emperor is obligated by law to appoint a junior co-Emperor by their sixtieth year. The elected officer
is then stripped of their family name and subjected to sterilization to prevent them from bearing children. The Imperial Scepter (See Archive 9 Section 2.C for what we have learned of the artifact Tyranny), granting control of the Knights of the Black Rose and the Imperial Eyes is passed on upon death or the Emperor reaching 80 years of age, whichever comes first.

## Appendix A: Problems with Memory Extraction

The subject showed considerable distress during the process of memory extraction. Two lab aids were critically injured after she managed to escape the restraints. Pacification and punishment inflicted severe psychic stress resulting in difficulties with memory extraction. Information retrieved may be inaccurate.

## Appendix B: Recommendations for Action

Should it be necessary that to take action to delay or otherwise obstruct the Netherese forces I recommend the subject be released and be given provision to return to [[Base 17]]. It Is likely that she would cause problems amongst the advancing army, including potential mutiny and insurrection.

I received this document from a Kaedish Tribesman who found it in the home of a travelling scholar after a raid on the settlement at [[Aquilea]]. I am basing my translation on the esteemed work of the Illyrian scholar Maximius. I dedicate this work to our most esteemed Empress [[Xaira]] and Adjunct [[Cassius Vecna]], in the 5,012th Year of Time's Sleep.

After the death of our... the alliance disbanded. The wizard [[Nale]] took [[Cephus]] and went to the Coast of [[Alkear]]. I believe he has a falling out with...

_The rest of the document is too hard for me to read. I believe he continues with a discussion of the whereabouts of [[Cetus]], as its bearer left the the company as well._

There were then six who remained. They bid farewell to the the people remaining. They each of them were secretive. Their motives were unknown to us at the time. I saw [[Lana]] who wielded the sword [[Carina]] speak to... with the death of Je.. she looked to be their leader.

The six of them gave their destination as the Isle of [[Caeta]] when people begged for them to stay. They said their affairs were of great consequence. The Isle was somewhere off [[The Ceon Sea|the Western Sea]]. She said that it would only be
found again if [[Carina]] willed that it would. Then they were gone. There are reports that Letus *(maybe [[Cetus]]?)* was seen again, and a few less credulous reports of the others. But [[Lana]] never returned.

Continuing with a summary of the story of [[the Kingdom of the Dawn]]:

With [[The Order of the Magi|the Council of Magi]] leading the Twin Assemblies the Realm prospered for a time. The Kingdom expanded its power and influence with [[Telam]] at the helm of state and [[Casia]] at his side. To the greatest sailor in the land, [[Lana]], [[Telam]] gave the sword [[Carina]]. [[Lana]], who, at the command of [[the Redmoon Marines]], would come to be known as Lana Stormlord, embarked on many voyages of discovery across the sea to foreign lands. The law and administration of the Realm was entrusted into the wise and steady hands of [[Nale]], who promulgated a great code of laws and oversaw the prosecution of the ills of the community. The craft of war making was mastered by the Realm’s greatest warrior, [[Vitellius]]. The great general, at the command of one thousand horse, extended the dominion of the Magi into the South by conquering the lands of [[Caldea]]. [[Ezrien]] assumed wardenship of the forests, leading men west into the dark center of the continent, where he mediated disputes between the barbarian tribes, Elves, and encroaching settlers. Thus passed many years under the stewardship of [[Telam]] and the order of the Magi: Through the fires of war brought by [[Vitellius]], the founding of colonies by [[Lana]] and [[Miran]], and the sweet words and negotiations of [[Casia]] and [[Aneius]], the wealth, power, and prestige of [[the Kingdom of the Dawn]] stretched across the whole extent of the Eastern and Southern parts of [[Terros]] and across many of its coasts and islands.

But conflict soon arose in disparate parts of the Realm. First, while [[Telam's Castle]] lay dormant near the capital, the Master of All Making himself gone on an errand. [[Casia]] went inside. While [[Telam]] made the great blades to wield power over the Heavens on [[Terros]], eight only had been made; no blade was made for the Master Mage of [[Ishivan]]. In his absence, [[Casia]] wielded the instruments of her former master, and crafted herself [[Vespa]], the Sword of Knowledge. Upon learning of this treachery, a fight began between [[Telam]] and [[Casia]] which lasted ten days and ten nights as they fought outside the capital atop Telam’s high flying castle.
But neither could best the other. Remembering their former friendship, a compromise was reached. [[Casia]] would be exiled to [[Tel Dorac]] across the Sea. She left for [[Tel Dorac]], accompanied by her friend [[Aneius]], and they did not return for many years.

In the absence of the Master Mage, [[Telam]] ruled alone. He retreated further and further into isolation, ruling by edicts proclaimed from high in his castle. His isolation continued for five years until he was suddenly married to a woman named [[Telina]], a southerner from the conquered lands of [[Caldea]]. To them a son was born, a prince named Cerinthus. But he was more commonly known as [[Henly]], a nickname given to him as a child in the army camps of the South.

The realm was mostly peaceful, but mounting skirmishes with the Elves in the forests and a rebellion in [[Caldea]], which had to be reconquered, put strain on the leadership of [[Telam]].

But tragedy soon again struck the Realm. [[Ezrien]] had married an Elven woman and begun to try and halt the advance of settlers. [[Ezrien]] and [[Rosaniya]], as she was known by men, were soon known as enemies of the Kingdom of Men, and soon war would follow. At a meeting of Elves and Men to negotiate a peace over a dispute of land, the settlers betrayed the Elves, and the representatives of the Elves were slain, [[Rosaniya]] among them. [[Ezrien]] said nothing upon hearing the news. In silence left the company of his friends and companions and travelled deep into [[the Ironwoods]]. He returned one month later atop [[Nicephoros]], King of the Dragons, and was hence known as [[Ezrien]] Dragonlord, and a great war between elves and men began. For the first time, the Elves organized themselves into great armies, commanded by a new King of the Elves, [[Ezrien]]. With this great Elven army approaching settled lands, [[Telam]] sent his son and the General [[Cadmus]] of [[Caldea]] into the [[Bezen]] to conquer the [[God of Winter]], and bind him to the service of Man. But the passage was long, and the army of [[Cadmus]] and [[Henly]] would never return. So the war progressed without the aid of the winter God.

At the outbreak of the war, the Empire of Dawn is said to have maintained over one hundred thousand men at arms. Within three months of fighting, the Lord of Dragons had reduced that number to ash. By the Dragon’s Fire and the fury of the Elves the cities of [[The Centerlands]] were laid to ruin. The kingdom buckled, on the brink of collapse, but instead of taking up the defense of the Realm, [[Telam]] had retreated to his castle. He spoke to no one; the only noise from the castle was a constant spellcasting.

The Elven host marched through [[The Centerlands]] to [[Caldea]]. There, [[Vitellius]] met [[Ezrien]] and his host of Dragons in battle. The Flame of Attica, immune to the flames of the Dragon [[Nicephoros]], slew the King of Dragons and smote his ruin into the fields of the East. [[Ezrien]] took up [[Lacerta]], sword of the Forest, and the [[Codex de Natura]], transforming himself into a great Phoenix. He casted [[Vitellius]] into the Sea and the city of [[Caldea]], Jewel of the East, was no more. [[Vitellius]] lived only by the power of Lana, who saved him from the watery depths. The Dragonlord [[Ezrien]] then flew to the seat of Attish power, the castle of [[Telam]], and with the Sun
setting, was reduced to mortal form. In the ruins of [[Caldea]], the Elves prayed for their valiant warlord. They witness by air the return of [[Casia]], fast making towards [[Telam]].

Standing below Telam’s high flying castle, the elven warlord called forth the Master of Making, decrying him king of slaves and defiler of the earth. [[Telam]] soon emerged, and [[Ezrien]] readied himself to slay his great foe and reduce the world of men to ash.

But it was not to be so. No great battle was fought on the Fields of [[Acadia]], for [[Casia]], the master mage, had arrived. The mage had returned from [[Tel Dorac]]. She reminded [[Ezrien]] of their long friendship, and they talked for many days, all while [[Telam]] watched from the high castle. [[Ezrien]] then returned to his Elven host. Bidding them to lay down their weapons, to return to their way of life. He led them into the West, far from Telam, onto the shores of [[The Ceon Sea]], to live a life away from the Realm of Men. [[Telam]] and [[Casia]] were thus reunited, and for her saving the land, [[Casia]] was once again brought into the Kingdom of Attica. The Nine who had once ruled the land would fight again the same banner, when [[Telam]] had gathered them all for a last great war against [[The God of Time|Time]]. But this would be the last time for such a reunion, and the last war of the Kingdom of the Dawn. The armies of [[Attica]] marched to [[The World-Soul|the Soul of the World]] to confront the Lord of Time. The Master Mage [[Casia]] used the [[Vespa|Sword of Knowledge]] to channel [[The World-Soul]], and bring forth to [[Terros]] [[The God of Time]], and [[Telam]] vanquished him, burying him deep below the [[Isle of Faith]], beginning the long wait of Time’s Sleep. In the battle two Magi fell: [[Vitellius]] and [[Telam]] would never again see the sun’s shine.

After the battle, [[Eudoxus]] went to the capital, [[Nale]] across the Sea to the South, and the rest of the Magi to the Isle of [[Caeta]], an Isle across [[The Ceon Sea]]. In the absence of their leaders, the weary Kingdom collapsed. A great madness overtook the lands of [[Terros]]. Towns lay abandoned, farmland untilled, law codes forgotten. North of the Channel, it would not be until the rebirth of [[Illyria]] that the lands of Men would boast a great Kingdom. And as for the Master Mage, it is said she was finally laid to rest at the city of [[Vejlan]] in [[The Pale]], in the fourth millennium, where the capital of Attica had once laid.

## January 29th, 284 NE

Rightly did the sailors speak of the wealth and civility of these lands. Just yesterday I passed through the city of [[Athina]] on the banks of [[the Locke River]]. In conversation with a merchant from the Capital passing through the city I discovered that it had been founded only twenty years earlier. It was nothing but a small fishing town occupied by the passing legions. They constructed a small fortress which had developed with rapid speed into the beautiful city which now stands before me. The streets laid with fine stone, the aqueduct running water from the mountains, the chiseled statues of the Saints of the Valley, the high-rising amphitheatre, all wrought with exquisite craftsmanship, speak to the expansion of the civil society in these lands. I cannot help but stand in awe at the accomplishments of this Emperor Maximilian for I have seen their majesty with my own eyes.

I must confess however that I feel an overpowering sense of dread as my journey stretches around [[the Myr Mountains]]. I have been in [[The Empire]] of [[Netheril]] more than a month, but these conquered lands still retain the flavor of [[The Centerlands]]. Not for over a thousand years has a [[Blackstar]] set foot in the West, yet I soon I will arrive in the city that rose to replace [[Westgard]] seeking the help of a foreign ruler who owes me no respect. I suspect I my despair also arose by the grim nature of my business and the determination of my resolve. Should my fears manifest then I believe it will be to the ruin of all civilized lands. 

Far north I ventured into lands which have no name. The Sharans spoke of the lands simply as [[Aer-Valock]] or ‘Frozen Waste’. But what insights I have taken from the place far exceed any which can be found in the dusty halls of the Tower of the Rose or the Imperial College. 

The scholar [[Veryn]] spoke true, a wise man did indeed live in a great fortress at the center of a frigid lake. Having arrived on his doorstep he greeted me and bid me inside 

His fortress was ancient; though he would not say by what peoples it was erected. A great many tomes he had accumulated, and he soon impressed me with his wisdom on all things. His retreat into these wastes had not dulled his mind nor his senses; he spoke with a great acumen on the politics of the day and of the future of the Realm. With a heavy heart I soon broached my business and by the shadow that came over his face I knew that Veryn spoke right that this man long had thought of my troubles.

He too had sought answers regarding the fate of [[Telam|the Master Maker]] and [[The Order of the Magi]]. He conveyed to me that for many years he concentrated his sorcery across the Seas of the West, but to no avail. A shadow lay over that place which by no power could he abate. 

For a long time we conversed about the First Mage and the rise of the Kingdom of the Dawn, and what the words spoken by [[Casia]] would mean for the Realm. He confided in me that a great tragedy was approaching, and that the Realm must be strong to survive, thus confirming my suspicions. Late into the night we speculated on the nature of what was coming, but could reach no definite conclusions. He confirmed my calculations that this was the Fifteenth Age of the World and we were almost seven thousand years in the Age of Reason. This does indeed accord with the speech of the Sorcerer-Lords of Tel Dorac when they proclaimed that the Ages of the World grew shorter, and that time was shrinking thin. 

A plan though we soon reached. I would head into the West and beg an audience with the [[Emperor Maximilian]]. Should we win him to our cause we would assemble a great fleet of ships and sail into the Western Sea in search of the Isle of [[Caeta]] and the fate of the Order of Magi. 

  

## March 3rd, 285 NE


The vigor, sagacity, and prudence of the great Flame of the West did not fall below my expectations. Not only did he hear my requests, but he soon adopted me into his full faith and counsel and named me Imperial Adjunct. To me he pledged that the Empire which “stretched north to the Great [[Rockdale]], south to [[Norechium]] and [[the Sea of Scales]], and East into[[ the Ironwoods]] would now turn its gaze West in search of the truth of the Ages of Man”. In my company many schemes we soon hatched both for the improvement and health of his Realm and for the people of [[Terros]]. But the time had come to set our ultimate designs in motion and begin our journey west.

  

## October 4th, 287 NE

Today is the day that my long held desires are realizing themselves. I set sail commanding a fleet of twenty ships of the Imperial Legion across [[The Ceon Sea]] to find this Isle of Caeta. 

Upon my sailing this I know, that only five of the [[The Order of the Magi|Magi]] made it on a boat to [[Caeta]]: [[Casia]], who had become their leader; [[Ezrien]], who had by this time returned from the Elven lands into alliance with his old friends; [[Lana]], whose ship and protection they would be sailing west under; [[Miran]], the lord of the Sands; and lastly the Keeper [[Aneius]], whose motivations I have had the hardest time unearthing. I know that [[Aneius]] was entrusted with the sword [[Corvus]], and it is said by some ancient historians that he travelled to the other side of [[the Black Gate]] into the Halls of the Dead, but this I find hard to believe. It was said by [[Diosophenes]] that no man can exit the Halls of the Dead, not even him. And it was by [[the Book of the Dead]] composed by [[Aneius]] that Diosophenes composed his teachings, making him I believe the definitive source on the supposed travelling of [[Aneius]]. 

I know that three at least have returned, or at least their blades have. It appears that [[Aneius]], [[Miran]], and [[Ezrien]] all made their way back to [[Terros]]. With [[Casia]] I cannot confirm her passing back to [[Terros]], but her blade did at least, being carried by a wise sage into [[The Pale]]. Their high priests there still pass devotion to a Saint which they know not is [[Casia]]. 

By the chronicaller [[Marcellus]] I know that [[Ezrien]] lived in the Ironwoods until his death, his tomb lost to [[the Kaltir Hills]] sometime in the third millennia. Though why he returned I know not. 

[[Miran]], I know from the Southlanders, moved into the [[Tesarin Valley]] and lead the desert tribes for many years before disappearing from the historical record. Once again his motivations remain mysterious to me.

[[Aneius]], recorded by the Illyrian historian [[Verenus]], arrived back in Terros sometime in the fourth millennia. He claims that he arrived in a city called [[Tela Aera]] on the Southern Coast and acquired a fleet of ships, then sailed across the channel into [[Alos]], never to be seen again. They spoke of him in a terrible fury, that he spoke to no one of his businesses and made with great haste out of these lands. 

Perhaps when I find the island my questions will be answered, but for now all that is within my power is to wait for the winds to catch our sails and to head out onto the open sea. The whole fate of the  world appears to lie before me, ready to be uncovered. I hope for all our sakes it is not so terrible.

Say barkeep, set a round of drink,
[Bm]			[F#m]

Tonight we’ll raise our glasses to

Whoever held a [[The Elder Blades|blade]]!
[D]		       [A]
For all  [[The Order of the Magi|the mages]] did for us,

A drink seems only fair.
[F#m]
But if they don’t show up tonight,

[Bm]			    [F#m]
We even saved them a chair!
[F#m]
But their ten blades have all decayed,
[C#]				    [F#m]
So we guess we’ll drink their shares!


[[Aneius]] you’ll hope not to meet,
For [[Corvus]] he did wield,
That mage of death crafted a bomb,
And [[Corytha]]’s now a field
But the souls still passed through that [[the Black Gate|Black Gate]],
So a drink seems only fair,
But his inhumane change of terrain
Means I’ll have to drink his share!

[Chorus]

[[Ezrien]], the mage of nature,
With [[Lacerta]] he did quest
To find an elven bride to wed
Within the dark forest
And now the elves, they are our friends,
So a drink seems only fair,
But his newlywed, she turned up dead,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

[[Eudoxus]], he was geriatric,
Gods, he was a loon!
He took [[Cetus]] to outer space,
And made [[Arcterus|another moon]].
But now the night is brighter,
So a drink seems only fair,
But he can’t think nor much less drink,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]


[[Vitellius]] had a fire temper,
His heart and sword aflame,
[[Cygnus]] would sedate the God,
And give ol’ V his fame.
And because this hearth is warm,
A drink seems only fair,
But he’s in his den chatting with [[Ten]],
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

So take a trip to [[Alos]], 
There with [[Cephus]], you’ll find [[Nale]],
He advised the king with spellcasting,
They should have had him jailed.
But because the war is over,
A drink seems only fair,
But his lifestyle’s now “in exile,”
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

Oh [[Miran]], he’s an old sand flea,
Crafted with [[Caelum]] in hand.
He sailed across [[The Ceon Sea]],
So on [[Caeta]] he could stand.
And because he built our castles,
Well, a drink seems only fair,
But he’s down on the beach, eating a peach,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]


[[Lana]] held the Sword of Water,
Yes, [[Carina]] she did guide.
She caused great waves, too many graves,
And expanded the beachside!
But because the fish are biting,
A drink seems only fair,
But stuck is she, below the sea,
So I guess I’ll drink her share!

[Chorus]

That brings us to the Master Maker,
Oh [[Telam]] he was a foe!
With [[Tevas]] prime, the sword of time,
The Gods he’d overthrow!
And because we’re growing older,
A drink seems only fair,
But he’s still the vassal of [[Telam's Castle|a flying castle]],
So I guess I’ll drink his share!

[Chorus]

Prince [[Henly]] was the Maker’s son,
A spoiled errand boy,
But he still reigned on [[The Winter Plane]]
[[Croxeor]] was no simple toy.
And the winter’s wrath was kind this year,
So a drink seems only fair,
And it’s a crime, he’s stuck back in time,
So I guess I’ll drink his share!


[Chorus]

Slick [[Casia]] was [[Telam]]’s right hand,
But still did wield no sword,
So she snuck inside his forge one night,
His warnings were ignored.
And because we all love magic,
A drink seems only fair,
But her one goal’s [[The World-Soul]],
So I guess I’ll drink her share!

[Chorus, but Slowed]

To your eminence Prof. [[Friedrich Redding]],

Once again our diagram has proved its infinite wisdom. My spies in the lands south of [[Shara]] have reported the false-prince [[Lothair]]'s troops have crossed [[the River Brenick]] on the 5th of May. I think we can conclude they will indeed reach [[Fort James]] on the third or forth week of May. As we expected, [[Prof. Eidelberg]]'s seeing yielded truth - the [[Lady Vera]] accompanies them and she carries on her person a section of the [[Codex de Caelus]] Given that this was proved true, I think we can assume that it is indeed the section Of Motion. 

Furthermore, I have dispatched our agent, a woman named [[Anna de Heyda]], who I hold in very high esteem, to replace our fallen comrades in [[Illyria]]. Given that the city's fall should be immanent, I think we need someone on the scene.  Also, I recommend we give another student a chance at interpreting that section of the diagram. With I highest respect I must comment that our knowledge of the fall of Illyria is not in proportion to the magnitude of its importance. 

With great respect,

[[Elaida Avear]], May 12th, 587 NE

Elaida,

As I have said before - in [[Jena]] we do not recognize the difference between lordsman and servant, you needn't write with such formality, you have been elevated to the position of Master Mage for a reason. Now, I have just got a report from  the inquisitors in [[Fort James]] who have been questioning the man [[Marc]]. He works for the court wizard to the [[Queen Ilvana]] of [[Neverwinter]]. This man is, whose name I am told is [[Tameran Vacilio]], is in possession of a section of the [[Codex de Caelus]], though we do not as of yet believe he actually knows what it is or what to do with it.  I am sending some agents to find him and deal with him. We also do not believe that he possesses enough of it to be useful, though we are not sure on that detail. We are still a negative on finding the grave of the Wizard [[Eudoxus]] - all we have is that damned seeing from [[Kane]].

In other news, all the preparations are made for when [[Lothair|the Iron Prince]] and his armies arrive. That double-crossing, sightless coward will know his mistake. I do not know what His plans are, but [[Cassius Vecna|Vecna]]  has prepared [[Corvus]], so I think it will be something to remember. This will likely be your first taste of a true battle, but I  would not worry in the slightest, an enemy is always weakest when he thinks he has gained the upper hand. His men will be trapped where the think they are safest. 

One last thing, I will be returning to [[Jena]] from [[Caldaria]] on May 12th, leave your report for me and I can pick it up through the portal, as I think you'll have departed by that point. When you return though, we must meet and discuss strategy.

Born on the 5th of the 11th Month in the Year 887. Calendar Conversion Unknown. Age 26. She was born in [[Netheril|the Imperial City]] to the family De Roya of the 7th Rank. She spent most of childhood in the city of [[Caldaria]] with brief stays in imperial outposts in the Hinterlands (Reference unknown). Beginning age 12 she was educated at the Academy for Young Officers before moving to the Imperial University Officer School age 15, where based on performance she was inducted into the Imperial Court.

She took part in her first campaign in 904, joining the army of the Imperial Second Velen against [[The Holy League]] (Reference unknown). After two years she had been promoted to the rank of Captain and took part in the conquest of the Holy City of Centas in 906. She fled the city three months later after rebellion by the natives resulted in the massacre of most of the troops stationed. Memory indicates she escaped by hiding in the cart of a deaf merchant leaving the city. 

She took part in the pacification of the rebellion. Her memory indicates the city was destroyed (note: memory analysis was hindered by extremity of emotions; details were unable to be extracted). For services rendered she was granted her request to join the expeditionary force, leaving Terros in 908, age 21.

> Two nights ago we suffered an attack on the Warpcamp at [[Caeta|Telam’s Gate]]. The enemies attacked without warning and the defenders were overcome. 2,000 soldiers were killed, along with the 10,000 members of the civilian population. The one responsible for the attack was the leader of the [[Tela Verii]], a people who had made a pact of peace with us ten years ago when first encountered by our late [[Emperor Caius]]. The main weapon in the attack was a powerful demon unleased by our enemies.
> Concurrent with the attack on the expeditionary force, the soldiers of [[The Holy League]] crossed [[the Sontar river]] and attacked our positions along the riverbank, pushing our defenders north out of the Sontar valley along with attacks along the eastern frontier from the city of [[Celast]]. The sorcerer responsible for killing our beloved Emperor Caius was released from captivity there.
> It is a dark day for our nation. We have suffered many loses. But our resolve is firm. Our enemies have rejected all attempts at peace forced us into conflict. The Senate has hearby made a declaration of war against the Tela Verii, the Holy League, and all their allies. The crimes committed against our nation will be payed for twice over in blood, and we will not rest until both the leader of the Tela Verii and the Church have been punished for their injustices.

Once wielded [[Corvus]].

## Young Vecna (2400 Years ago):
Perhaps teenagers, the oldest maybe 20. Traveled in a band of three, accompanied by his wife, the Empress [[Xaira]], and the Achon of Ademon and the founder of the Church of Death, [[Diosophanes]].

The group traveled to [[The Pale|Attica]] [Modern day Pale] to search out the wisdom of a sage. Learned magic and reason there.

At the height of the empire, Vecna had just slain [[the Dragon of Ilgrove]] when he had returned to the castle of the Governor of [[Northumbria]] for rest. Here he had his vision that the empire would fall, and the Realm was doomed to tyranny and chaos.

When he told the Achon Diosophanes, he was declared as opposed to the Father of Mankind, after which there was a duel resulting in the death of the Achon and significant damage to the city.

After this, he journeyed north to make the diagram and found [[the University of Jena]].

## Present Vecna: 
A man, of average height, with long black hair. He has a gaunt face, his eyes sort of hollow, like he is straining to see. His left hand is missing and his right arm is clearly bandaged.

Vecna is a title. By birth he was named Cassius. In [[the Northern Realms]] he was called Mazrim. In the Illyrian Imperial Province of Northumbria, which included what is today the Northern Realms, the adjunct [representative, second in command] to the Empress was hailed by the name of Mazrim after he slew a dragon, in honor of the old king Mazrim, who was called the Dragon of the North.

The war between [[Netheril]], [[Cormyr]], and the Northern Realms was entirely the responsibility of the agents of the[[ Prince Lothair]], not Vecna.

Vibed with Gotts Chalk in a box for a while.

#person #mage #blackstar #human #blue-company 

From a very long time ago.

Potentially related to Vecna, but not his brother. 

Conquered modern day [[Cormyr]] and [[Netheril]], bringing it into the Illyrian empire. Got the name [[Blackstar]] because he knew a lot about astrology, particularly that an eclipse was coming, and attacked some barbarian armies in the west who unified against the encroaching Illyrians during the eclipse with fire magic. He was named warden of the west, ruled from [[Westgard]], which was west of Netheril- currently underwater.
